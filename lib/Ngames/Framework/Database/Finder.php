 * The finder class is a higher level API to access the database than the Connection one.
 * Methods will return/save instances of model classes rather than just arrays.
 *
 * SQL queries params have to be built by hand. If the queried model contains references, then the query may contain values for the reference.
 * The property name for the reference ust be a prefix to the reference property.
 * Example:
 * This query: SELECT m.id, u.id as user_id FROM messages m JOIN users u ON m.user_id = u.id
 * could lead to this model: [Message]{ id: '123', user: [User]{ id: '456' } }
